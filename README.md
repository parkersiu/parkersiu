I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating useful technology and solving difficult problems. I currently work as a software integration engineer for a software company in the broadband industry. We deliver a highly scalable billing and provisioning service for hundreds of customers. I manage new and existing projects to install, configure, and integrate our software with third party SOAP, REST API and Webhook services.
